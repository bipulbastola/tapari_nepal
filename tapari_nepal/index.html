        	<p><em> Tapari</em>, <em>Duna</em> and <em>Bota</em> are the disposable, multipurpose leaf plates and bowls made by stitching Saal ko Paat with a small bamboo sticks.

            <h3>Religious Significane</h3>
            <p>It is said that Queen Maya Devi, mother of Gautam Buddha, gave birth to the Lord under a Sal tree or the Ashoka tree in the garden in Lumbini while she grasped its branch. Legend also has it that four pairs of Sal trees growing around Buddhaâ€™s bed had suddenly turned white when he had died. Also, most of the temples in the Kathmandu valley was made up of bricks and Sal tree wood which adds up to its religious significance.</p>
